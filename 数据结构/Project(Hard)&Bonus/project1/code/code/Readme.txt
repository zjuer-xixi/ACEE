Here are the steps to run and test the project1.c file:

1. Open project1.c and click the run button to launch the .exe window.
2. Input a positive integer (representing the matrix dimension) and the code will automatically run and display information, including the original matrix, the display of the maximum sub-matrix, the display of the runtime, and the maximum value.

Regarding the modification of the loop count, K: 

You can modify the macro definitions at lines 4-6 to change the loop count for the algorithm. (K1 represents the loop count for algorithm 1, K2 represents the loop count for algorithm 2, and K3 represents the loop count for algorithm 3.)
